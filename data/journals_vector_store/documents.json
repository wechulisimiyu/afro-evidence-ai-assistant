This retrospective study aimed to determine predictive factors for a \npositive prostate biopsy in Chinese men. Data were collected from 1608 men who underwent a prostate \nbiopsy for suspected prostate cancer. Variables analyzed included age, prostate specific antigen (PSA) \nlevel, prostate volume and PSA density (PSAD). Logistic regression analysis estimated relative risk, 95% \nconfidence intervals and p values. Overall, 598 (37.19%) of the 1608 biopsied had prostate cancer. \nIndependent predictors of a positive biopsy result include advanced age, elevated PSA levels, small \nprostate volume and increased PSAD. Our study showed significant predictors for positive prostate \nbiopsy in Chinese men and a combination of age, PSA, prostate volume and PSAD better defined the \nprobability of a positive biopsy than any factor alone. In the future, we may be able to use our finding to \ncreate a nomogram for predicting positive prostate biopsy in Chinese men. \n \nKey words: Prostate biopsy, PSA, prostate volume, prostatic neoplasms. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nProstate cancer (PCa) is now recognized as one of the \nprincipal medical problems facing the male population. \nWidespread use of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) \nscreening has revolutionized the diagnosis of PCa \n(Polascik et al., 1999). However, PSA is organ-specific \nand not cancer-specific (Ablin, 1972), which is elevated \nnot only in patients with PCa, but also in various \nnonmalignant \nconditions \nincluding \ninfections, \nand \nover-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen and benign prostatic \nhyperplasia (BPH) (Liu et al., 2009). Although debate \nabout the appropriate PSA cut-point for PCa early \ndetection programs continues, a level of total PSA of 4.0 \nng/ml has traditionally been used as the threshold for \nconsideration of a prostate biopsy. In general, only \napproximately 25% of men undergoing biopsy will receive  \n \n \n \n*Corresponding author. E-mail: txiner301@gmail.com. Tel: \n86-10-6693-9532.
